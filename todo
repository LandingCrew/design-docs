Documentation & Design Tasks (No Unreal Required)
1. Complete or Refine Design Documents
Many subsystem docs are marked as "Draft"
Expand incomplete sections (you mentioned the Memoria AI doc is a WIP)
Add cross-references between related systems
Fill in "Open Questions" sections
2. Content Design
Write quest narratives and dialogue
Design enemy encounters and Nemesis system characters
Create item descriptions and lore
Develop faction storylines
Design dungeons and locations on paper
3. Game Balance & Math
Tune combat formulas and damage calculations
Balance progression curves
Create loot tables and drop rates
Design skill progression XP curves
Balance economy (merchant gold, item values)
4. Implementation Planning
You have an implementation folder - work on:

Architecture documents
Technical specifications
Data schemas for game systems
API designs for modding support
5. Writing & World Building
Expand lore documents
Create NPC backstories
Write in-game books and notes
Design religion/deity descriptions (you have 61 deities!)
Develop regional cultures and histories
6. System Design Refinement
Looking at your modified file (memoria-ai-assistance.md), you could work on:

UX/UI wireframes and flowcharts
Menu system designs (already well documented)
HUD layout mockups
Controller mapping schemes
Accessibility features
7. Tools & Scripts
Create Python/JavaScript tools to validate design consistency
Build calculators for damage formulas
Generate data files from design specs
Create documentation generators
8. Community & Presentation
Create pitch documents
Write dev blogs about design decisions
Prepare design portfolios for team members
Document design rationale and influences
Would you like me to help with any specific task from these categories? For example, I could help:

Organize and improve existing documentation
Create balance spreadsheets
Write scripts to validate data consistency
Expand specific game systems
Create implementation roadmaps
What area interests you most right now?

lets look at Game Balance & Math
Task:Find balance and math files
IN
Find all files that contain game balance formulas, damage calculations, progression curves, XP calculations, and mathematical systems. Look for:
- Combat formulas
- Damage calculations
- XP/leveling formulas
- Economy balance
- Stat calculations
- Progression systems
- Any spreadsheets or data files with numbers

I need to understand what balance work has been done and what needs attention.

Excellent! The exploration agent found a comprehensive overview of your game balance systems. Based on this analysis, here's what we can work on:

Game Balance & Math - What We Can Do Now
Areas Ready for Work:
1. Create Balance Spreadsheets
Build Excel/Google Sheets calculators for:

Damage output at different skill/gear combinations
DPS comparisons (Dual-wield vs Two-handed vs Archery)
Warrior vs Mage survivability analysis
Economy simulation (gold flow, merchant limits)
Leveling curve visualization
2. Fill Missing Formulas
Alchemy potion strength - needs exact calculation
Enchanting power scaling - how skill affects enchantment strength
Crafting XP formula - how fast do crafting skills grow?
Poison damage mechanics - DoT calculations
3. Balance Testing Simulations
We could build Python scripts to simulate:

Combat encounters (skill 20 vs skill 80)
Resource depletion over time
Critical hit probability distributions
Armor effectiveness curves
4. Resolve Open Design Questions
The docs have several unresolved questions like:

Should resistances stack multiplicatively or additively?
Critical hits separate from headshots?
Skill decay for unused skills?
Set bonuses for matching armor?
5. Build Comparison Tables
Create detailed comparisons for:

All weapon types (DPS, stamina cost, range)
Build archetypes (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Hybrid)
Material progression (Iron → Daedric value proposition)
Spell tiers cost-to-damage ratios
Which Would You Like to Tackle?
I can help you with:

A) Create spreadsheet calculators - Build interactive tools to test balance
B) Write missing formulas - Complete Alchemy/Enchanting/Poison mechanics

C) Build simulation scripts - Python tools to test combat scenarios
D) Resolve design questions - Work through the open questions list
E) Create comparison tables - Visual guides for all systems

Or something specific you noticed in that analysis?
