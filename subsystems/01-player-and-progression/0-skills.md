# Skills

Skills are the primary focus of the player -  they determine what character they are building and roleplaying as.

There are 4 archtype skills:
- [[0-skills|Physicality]] contains all that which handles physical combat - swords, bows, dodging, etc...
- [[0-skills|Utility]] contains exploration and social based skills
- [[0-skills|Crafting]] contains ways to make useful things
- [[0-skills|Magic]] contains lore and spells trees

There are 20 skills total across these 4 archetypes.

Each skill:
- starts between 1-10
- cannot go negative
- has an exponential skill curve (ranking up requires more points per level)
- has an associated perk tree

When you generate a new character you assign:
- 3 major skills: bonus starting skill points +10
- 6 minor skills +5

## Skill → Stat Mapping

This table shows which skills contribute to which base stats (8 core stats):

**Stat Contribution Formula:**
```
stat_contribution = coefficient × ln(skill_level + 1)
```

**Contribution Tiers (Golden Ratio: 1.618):**
- **Major (M)** = 10.0 coefficient (Primary stat for this skill)
- **Greater (G)** = 6.18 coefficient (Strong secondary - split majors)
- **Lesser (L)** = 3.82 coefficient (Meaningful contribution)
- **Minor (m)** = 2.36 coefficient (Universal survivability - ALL skills grant AGI & END)

**Note:** Logarithmic scaling means the first 25 skill points give ~70% of maximum stat benefit, encouraging diverse builds over min-maxing a single skill.

**Legend:**
- **STR** = Strength (melee damage, carry weight, knockback)
- **AGI** = Agility (movement speed, dodge, attack animation speed)
- **DEX** = Dexterity (ranged accuracy, critical hits, precision tasks)
- **END** = Endurance (HP, stamina, physical resistance)
- **INT** = Intuition (magic pool, perception, natural magic affinity)
- **EDU** = Education (learned magic, crafting quality, knowledge)
- **SOC** = Social Standing (barter, persuasion, faction reputation)
- **LCK** = Luck (skill diversity based - see below)

**Tier Symbols:**
- **M** = Major (10.0 coefficient)
- **G** = Greater (6.18 coefficient - split majors)
- **L** = Lesser (3.82 coefficient)
- **m** = Minor (2.36 coefficient - universal survivability, ALL skills have this for AGI & END)

**Stat Distribution Summary:**
- **Strength**: 6 skills (3 Major: Combat Arts, One-Handed, Two-Handed | 3 Lesser: Heavy Armor, Finesse, Smithing)
- **Agility**: 20 skills (2 Major: Evasion, Sneak | 6 Lesser: Combat Arts, One-Handed, Evocation, Abjuration | 20 Minor: ALL skills for survivability)
- **Dexterity**: 6 skills (3 Major: Marksman, Finesse, Subterfuge | 3 Lesser: Combat Arts, Wayfarer, Smithing)
- **Endurance**: 20 skills (2 Major: Heavy Armor, Wayfarer | 8 Lesser: Evasion, Combat Arts, Smithing, Conjuration, Evocation, Abjuration | 20 Minor: ALL skills for survivability)
- **Intuition**: 10 skills (2 Major: Illusion, Mysticism | 2 Greater: Evocation, Divine Arts | 6 Lesser: Sneak, Wayfarer, Influence, Alchemy, Abjuration, Conjuration)
- **Education**: 9 skills (5 Major: Smithing, Alchemy, Conjuration, Abjuration, Enchanting | 2 Greater: Evocation, Divine Arts | 2 Lesser: Mysticism, Marksman)
- **Social Standing**: 4 skills (2 Major: Influence, Subterfuge | 2 Lesser: Divine Arts, Wayfarer)
- **Luck**: Calculated from skill diversity - see Luck formula below

> **Design Notes:**
> - **Logarithmic Scaling**: All stat contributions use `coefficient × ln(skill + 1)` for diminishing returns
> - **Universal Survivability**: ALL 20 skills grant Minor (2.36) to both Agility and Endurance, preventing archetype starvation
> - **Split Major Stats**: Evocation and Divine Arts use Greater (6.18) for both INT and EDU, representing natural talent + learned technique
> - **Agility Balance**: All skills grant Minor AGI (survivability), with Major from Evasion/Sneak and Lesser from combat-mobility skills
> - **Endurance Balance**: All skills grant Minor END (survivability), with Major from Heavy Armor/Wayfarer and Lesser from physically-demanding skills
> - **Dexterity Focus**: Only 3 Major sources (Marksman, Finesse, Subterfuge) to prevent over-indexing precision builds
> - **Intuition Sources**: 2 Major (Illusion, Mysticism), 2 Greater (Evocation, Divine Arts), 6 Lesser for diverse magic builds
> - **Education Sources**: 5 Major crafting/magic skills, 2 Greater (Evocation, Divine Arts), 2 Lesser for knowledge-seekers
> - **Social Standing**: 2 Major paths (Influence = overt diplomacy, Subterfuge = covert manipulation), 2 Lesser (Divine Arts = religious authority, Wayfarer = wilderness networks)
> - **Luck Formula**: `NORM.DIST(skills_invested, AVERAGE(stats), STDEV(stats), FALSE) × 100` - rewards skill diversity and balanced stat distribution, not total skill points

## Luck Calculation

Unlike other stats, **Luck is calculated dynamically** based on your playstyle:

```
Luck = NORM.DIST(skills_invested, AVERAGE(stats), STDEV(stats), FALSE) × 100
```

**Where:**
- **skills_invested**: Total number of different skills you've put points into (0-20)
- **AVERAGE(stats)**: Mean of your 7 primary stats (STR, AGI, DEX, END, INT, EDU, SOC)
- **STDEV(stats)**: Standard deviation of those stats

**What This Means:**
- **Jack-of-all-trades** (15+ different skills, balanced stats): High Luck (~8-12)
- **Focused hybrid** (6-10 skills, moderate variance): Medium Luck (~4-7)
- **Pure specialist** (3-5 skills, high variance): Low Luck (~1-3)

**Design Philosophy:** Lucky adventurers are well-rounded and have diverse experiences. Specialists don't get lucky - they rely on mastery and preparation, not chance.

**Additional Luck Sources:**
- **Gear**: Enchanted items, lucky charms, blessed amulets
- **Perks**: Destiny perks or special abilities that grant flat Luck bonuses
- **Consumables**: Luck potions, fortunes, blessings from shrines
- **Traits/Race**: Some character creation choices may grant starting Luck bonuses

Base Luck from skill diversity is **additive** with these bonuses.
