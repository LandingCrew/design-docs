# Skills

Skills are the primary focus of the player -  they determine what character they are building and roleplaying as.

There are 4 archtype skills:
- [[0-skills|Physicality]] contains all that which handles physical combat - swords, bows, dodging, etc...
- [[0-skills|Utility]] contains exploration and social based skills
- [[0-skills|Crafting]] contains ways to make useful things
- [[0-skills|Magic]] contains lore and spells trees

There are 20 skills total across these 4 archetypes.

Each skill:
- starts between 1-10
- cannot go negative
- has an exponential skill curve (ranking up requires more points per level)
- has an associated perk tree

When you generate a new character you assign:
- 3 major skills: bonus starting skill points +10
- 6 minor skills +5

> **Design Notes:**
> - **Split Major Stats**: Evocation and Divine Arts split their major contribution (0.05 INT + 0.05 EDU) representing both natural talent and learned technique
> - **Agility Rebalance**: Previously unmapped; now derives from movement-focused skills (Evasion, Sneak) and benefits battle mages who need mobility (Evocation, Abjuration minor)
> - **Dexterity Rebalance**: Reduced from 5 major skills to 3 to prevent over-indexing
> - **Intuition Rebalance**: Reduced from 5 pure major skills to 3 major + 2 split to balance magic stat progression
> - **Conjuration Design**: Shifted to Education-primary to represent summoning as learned knowledge rather than pure intuition
> - **Combat Mage Survivability**: Evocation grants AGI+END minor, Conjuration grants END minor, Abjuration grants AGI minor (representing active combat engagement and need for physical resilience)
> - **Social Connections**: Divine Arts grants SOC minor (religious/healing aspect), Subterfuge grants SOC minor (criminal underworld), Wayfarer grants SOC minor (wilderness guides, ranger networks, survival communities)
> - **Marksman Expertise**: Grants EDU minor (trajectory calculation, weapon maintenance knowledge, hunting lore)
> - **Luck Exception**: Has no direct skill-based progression; must be increased through perks, traits, or gear
