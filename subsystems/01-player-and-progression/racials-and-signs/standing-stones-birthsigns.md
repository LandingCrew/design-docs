2. **No Respec** - Choose once, permanent commitment (or limited respec via shrine)
3. **Scaling Bonuses** - Benefits improve as you master related skills
4. **Constellation Lore** - Tied to Elder Scrolls astrology and seasons
5. **Build Specialization** - Reinforces character identity

**Influences:**
- Oblivion (Birthsign system)
- Skyrim (Standing Stones + Andromeda mod)
- Requiem (Meaningful permanent choices)
- Classic RPGs (Star signs, horoscopes)

### Scaling Bonuses Explained

**Concept:** Rewards dedication to a playstyle

**Examples:**
1. **Warrior Stone** - Armor pen +5 → +10 when weapon skill = 100
2. **Mage Stone** - Spell power +10% → +20% when magic school = 100
3. **Lady Stone** - Regen +40% → +80% when any warrior skill = 100
4. **Thief Stone** - No extra dose → +1 poison dose when Alchemy = 100

**Philosophy:** Early power, late-game excellence

---

### Changing Stones (Respec)

**Option 1: Pilgrimage of Stars**
- Find hidden shrine (rare)
- Complete ritual quest
- Cost: 10,000 gold
- One-time use per playthrough

**Option 2: Scroll of Unbinding**
- Extremely rare drop (1 per playthrough)
- Use at any standing stone
- Allows re-selection

**Philosophy:** Commitment matters, but not permanent trap

---

## Build Archetypes by Stone

### Mage Builds

**The Mage** → Pure DPS mage (max spell power)
**The Apprentice** → Spell spammer (constant casting)
**The Atronach** → Anti-mage battlemage (absorb enemy spells)
**The Ritual** → Utility cleric (healing, summoning, holy fire)

### Thief Builds

**The Thief** → Pure rogue (lockpicking, stealth, poison)
**The Lover** → Social bard (speech, shouts, dodging)
**The Shadow** → Assassin (ultimate stealth)
**The Tower** → Merchant-thief (wealth + lockpicking)

### Hybrid Builds

---

## Lore Integration

**Each stone tied to in-game calendar:**

- Thief stones during winter (darkness, stealth)

**NPC reactions:**
- Nords respect Warrior stone users
- Mages College recognizes Mage stone users

---

## Balance Considerations

### Power Level

**Strongest Early Game:**
- The Warrior (+50 HP, +damage immediately useful)
- The Thief (+stealth, lockpicking, dodge)

**Strongest Late Game:**
- The Atronach (300 MP + spell absorption = unkillable mage)
- The Lady (80% regen when mastered = immortal)
- The Shadow (+armor pen when mastered)

**Most Challenging:**
- The Atronach (no MP regen = strategic resource management)
- The Apprentice (magic vulnerability)
- The Lord (fire weakness until mastery)

**Most Versatile:**
- The Warrior (everyone benefits from +damage)
- The Lover (+stamina regen helps all builds)
- The Steed (+speed, +carry weight universal)

## Open Questions

1. **Visual effects?** (Constellation glow on character?)
2. **Multiple stones?** (Collect minor bonuses from all, major from one?)
3. **Seasonal events?** (Bonus power during your stone's season?)
4. **Constellation quests?** (Unlock hidden powers via questline?)
5. **PvP balance?** (If multiplayer: some stones OP?)
6. **Permadeath integration?** (New character = new stone forced?)
7. **Dynamic bonuses?** (Stone power varies based on time of day/season?)

### Checking Bonuses (Pseudocode)

```cpp
float GetWeaponDamage(Player player, Weapon weapon) {
    float baseDamage = weapon.damage;
    float bonus = 1.0;

    if (player.hasStone("warrior")) {
        bonus += 0.10; // +10% damage
    }

    if (player.hasStone("mage") && weapon.isEnchanted) {
        if (player.hasSkill(weapon.enchantSchool, 100)) {
            bonus += 0.20; // +20% spell damage when mastered
        } else {
            bonus += 0.10; // +10% base
        }
    }

    return baseDamage * bonus;
}
```

## Summary

Standing Stones are **permanent character-defining choices** that:
- Define playstyle archetype (Warrior/Mage/Thief)
- Provide immediate power (early game bonuses)
- Scale with mastery (late game excellence)
- Encourage specialization (rewards dedication)
- Create build diversity (13 unique paths)

**The goal:** Make players say "I'm a Warrior Stone barbarian" or "I'm an Atronach battlemage" and have that choice fundamentally shape their playthrough.
