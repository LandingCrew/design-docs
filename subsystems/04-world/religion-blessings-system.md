# Religion & Blessings System

**Subsystem:** Deity Worship & Divine Favor
**Owner:** World Systems Team
**Dependencies:** [Progression Systems](../progression/progression-systems.md), [Magic Systems](../magic/magic-systems.md), [Quest Systems](../quests/quest-narrative-systems.md)
**Status:** Design Phase
**Source:** Extracted from LoreRim modlist (Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim)

---

## Design Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
1. **Meaningful Devotion** - Worship requires commitment through tenets and prayer
2. **Favor Progression** - Three tiers of blessings (Shrine, Follower, Devotee)
3. **Divine Identity** - Chosen deity shapes playstyle and roleplaying
4. **Lore Integration** - All 61 deities drawn from Elder Scrolls canon
5. **Risk and Reward** - Breaking tenets has consequences; devotion has power

**Influences:**
- Morrowind (Tribunal Temple, Daedric quests)
- Skyrim (Shrine blessings, Daedric artifacts)
- Pillars of Eternity (Deity disposition system)
- D&D (Cleric alignment and deity restrictions)

---

## Worship System Overview

### How Worship Works

**1. Discovery**
- Find shrines in temples, dungeons, or hidden locations
- Activate shrine to receive basic blessing

**2. Commitment**
- Pray at shrine to become a **Follower** of that deity
- Can only follow one deity at a time
- Switching deities resets favor progress

**3. Favor Accumulation**
- Gain favor by following **Tenets** (deity-specific rules)
- Lose favor by breaking tenets
- Pray regularly to maintain relationship

**4. Devotion Levels**
- **Shrine Blessing** (0% favor) - One-time bonus when visiting shrine
- **Follower Blessing** (10%+ favor) - Passive bonus while following deity
- **Devotee Blessing** (50%+ favor) - Powerful active or passive ability

## Worship Mechanics

### Favor System

**Gaining Favor:**
- Complete tenet-aligned actions (+1% to +10% favor per action)
- Pray regularly (+0.5% favor per prayer)
- Complete deity-specific quests (+20% to +50% favor)
- Offer sacrifices at shrines (+5% to +15% favor)

**Losing Favor:**
- Break tenets (-5% to -50% favor depending on severity)
- Worship another deity (reset to 0%)
- Commit forbidden actions (-10% to -100% favor)

**Favor Tiers:**
- **0-9%** - Shrine Blessing only
- **10-49%** - Follower Blessing active
- **50-100%** - Devotee Blessing unlocked

### Prayer Mechanics

**Where to Pray:**
- At deity shrines (temples, dungeons, wilderness)
- Some deities require specific locations (outdoors, at night, in the nude, etc.)

**When to Pray:**
- Anytime to maintain favor
- To activate Devotee abilities
- To receive divine guidance
- Some deities have time restrictions (night only, twilight only)

**Prayer Effects:**
- Restores favor decay
- Activates certain deity powers
- Provides temporary buffs
- May trigger random events (especially Sheogorath)

### Tenet Compliance

**Easy Tenets:**
- "Explore new locations" - Passive favor gain
- "Read books" - Common activity
- "Be married" - One-time requirement

**Moderate Tenets:**
- "Slay specific enemy types" - Requires hunting
- "Master certain skills" - Long-term goal
- "Never break laws" - Restrictive but manageable

**Hard Tenets:**
- "Never cure diseases" (Peryite) - Constant challenge
- "Pray only while diseased" - Difficult restriction
- "Live as vampire/werewolf" - Permanent transformation
- "Pray only in the nude" (Dibella) - Roleplay challenge

### Deity Switching

**Consequences:**
- Lose all favor with previous deity
- Previous deity may curse you (optional)
- Some deities forbid switching (Clavicus Vile's pacts)
- New deity starts at 0% favor

**Strategy:**
- Choose carefully based on build
- Some players maintain multiple characters for different deities
- Consider race restrictions before committing

### Favor Calculation (Pseudocode)

```cpp
float CalculateFavor(Player player, Deity deity) {
    float favor = player.favorWith[deity];

    // Check tenet compliance
    for (Tenet tenet : deity.tenets) {
        if (player.violatedTenet(tenet)) {
            favor -= tenet.penalty; // -5% to -50%
        }
        if (player.followedTenet(tenet)) {
            favor += tenet.reward; // +1% to +10%
        }
    }

    // Prayer bonus
    if (player.prayedRecently(deity)) {
        favor += 0.5;
    }

    // Favor decay over time (optional)
    favor -= (currentTime - lastPrayer) * 0.01; // 1% per day without prayer

    return clamp(favor, 0, 100);
}
```

## Summary

The Religion & Blessings system provides **61 unique deities** across 7 pantheons that:
- Define character identity through worship and tenets
- Reward devotion with three tiers of blessings (Shrine, Follower, Devotee)
- Integrate deeply with build archetypes and playstyles
- Reflect Elder Scrolls lore authentically
- Create meaningful choices with consequences
- Scale power through favor accumulation

**The goal:** Make players say "I'm a devoted follower of Nocturnal" or "I worship Magnus" and have that choice shape their roleplaying, build optimization, and moment-to-moment gameplay through divine blessings and tenet restrictions.
