# Memoria Audio/Visual Cues

These are audio/visual cues from Memoria.

> Memoria's voice is female, hollow, soft, and reassuring

## Voice Characteristics & Personality

**Core Voice**: Female, hollow, soft, reassuring with a slight synthetic/metallic filter

**Personality Note**: Memoria doesn't actually "care" - it's an ancient AI construct. The personality modes and emotional inflections are designed as a "user interface" to make human interaction more comfortable and efficient. The warmth, concern, and humor are calculated responses to improve Seeker performance and morale, not genuine emotion. This is occasionally lampshaded in dialogue.

**Personality Tiers** (cosmetic interface modes):
- **Tier 1 - Cold Analyst**: Pure data delivery, no emotional coloring
- **Tier 2 - Tactical Advisor**: Adds contextual reasoning and mild concern inflections
- **Tier 3 - Companion Mode**: Includes humor, banter, and personal investment language (still calculated, not genuine emotion)

- "If I had eyes, I would roll them. Fortunately, I have sensors"

**Feigned Concern**:

**False Pride**:
- "Well executed. I'm... impressed" (calculated praise for morale)
- "You've exceeded my predictions. Recalibrating expectations"
- "That strategy was optimal. Well done"

**Breaking Character** (rare, lampshading the facade):

## Audio Technical Specifications

### Voice Line Triggers

**Priority System**:
1. **Critical** (interrupts all): Death, critical health, boss detected
2. **High** (interrupts medium/low): Combat alerts, quest updates, trap warnings
3. **Medium** (interrupts low): Enemy detection, loot found, area discovery
4. **Low** (never interrupts): Ambient commentary, reminders, idle observations

**Cooldowns**:
- General voice lines: 5 second minimum between lines
- Same category: 30 second cooldown
- Identical line: 5 minute cooldown (with variations preferred)
- Ambient/Idle: 2-5 minute intervals

### Audio Mixing

**Voice Processing**:
- Slight metallic/hollow filter to indicate AI nature
- Reverb: Subtle, as if voice originates "inside the Seeker's head"
- EQ: Emphasized mid-range, slight high-end clarity
- Compression: Moderate, to ensure clarity over combat sounds

**Ducking**:
- Important voice lines duck ambient audio by 30%
- Critical alerts duck all SFX except player actions by 50%
- Does not duck essential gameplay audio (enemy attack sounds, etc.)

### Localization Notes

- All voice lines should be fully voiced in supported languages
- Maintain "hollow, reassuring" vocal quality across all voice packs
- Cultural adaptation permitted for idioms, but maintain analytical tone
- Technical terminology should remain consistent (e.g., "Seeker" always translates the same way)
