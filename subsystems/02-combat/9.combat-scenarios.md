## Combat Scenarios

### 1v1 Duel (Balanced Opponents)
- **Key:** Stamina management
- Block when low SP → regen
- Perfect block → punish
- Don't spam attacks

### 1vMany (Outnumbered)
- **Key:** Positioning, crowd control
- Use terrain (doorways, narrow paths)
- Sweeping attacks (greatswords)
- Kite with ranged
- **Don't get surrounded**

### Boss Fight (High Level Enemy)
- **Key:** Pattern recognition, patience
- Learn attack patterns
- Dodge high-damage attacks
- Punish openings
- Bring potions/buffs

### Stealth Approach
- **Key:** Not getting detected
- One-shot with stealth attacks
- If detected, flee or commit to combat
- Archery from range

## Finishers & Executions

**Trigger:** Enemy below 20% HP
**Prompt:** "Execute" button appears
**Effect:**
- Cinematic kill animation (skippable)
- Guaranteed kill
- Small HP/SP restore (perk)
- Intimidates nearby enemies (fear chance)

**Cost:** None (reward for winning fight)

---

## Death & Respawn

**On Death:**
1. Fade to black (0.5 sec)
2. Respawn at last rest point
3. Fade in (0.5 sec)
4. **Total downtime: ~2 seconds**

**Penalties:**
- None (death is punishment enough)
- Optional hardcore mode: Lose gold/items

**Philosophy:** Death teaches, doesn't punish excessively

## Combat Accessibility Options

## Open Questions

1. **Mounted combat?** (Horse archery, lance charges)
2. **Unarmed finishers?** (Wrestling moves for monk builds)
3. **Environmental kills?** (Kick off cliff, impale on spikes)
4. **Killcam replays?** (Optional cinematic on kills)
