## Alchemy - Potions & Poisons

### Discovery System

**Philosophy:** Learn through experimentation, not wiki lookup

**Ways to Learn Ingredient Properties:**

1. **Eat Raw Ingredient**
   - Discover 1st effect (out of 4)
   - Risk: Negative effects (poison, damage)
   - Reward: Free knowledge

2. **Experiment at Alchemy Table**
   - Combine 2-3 ingredients
   - If no match: Ingredients wasted, learn 1 property each
   - If match: Potion created, learn matching properties

3. **Read Alchemy Books**
   - Expensive (100-500g)
   - Reveals all properties of 5-10 ingredients
   - Safe but costly

4. **Talk to Alchemists**
   - Pay for knowledge (50g per ingredient)
   - Reveals all properties
   - Faster than books, less than experimenting
   - not all Alchemists no every ingredient

**Each ingredient has 4 hidden properties**

### Ingredient Example: Blue Valley Flower

**Hidden Properties:**
1. Restore magic
2. Fortify Health
3. Resist Shock
4. Fortify Conjuration

**Discovery Progress:**
- Eat raw → Learn property 1 (Restore magic)
- Combine with Wheat (Restore Health) → No match, wasted, learn 1 more property
- Combine with Lavender (Fortify Health) → **MATCH!** Create potion, learn property 2

**Over time, you build a mental encyclopedia**

### Potion Strength Formula

```
Magnitude = Base Effect × (Alchemy Skill / 50) × Ingredient Quality
```

**Example: Healing Potion (Blue Mountain Flower + Wheat)**

| Alchemy Skill | HP Restored | Duration (if applicable) |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| 15 | 8 HP | 10 sec |
| 25 | 12 HP | 15 sec |
| 50 | 25 HP | 30 sec |
| 75 | 37 HP | 45 sec |
| 100 | 50 HP | 60 sec |

**Same ingredients, better results with skill**

---

### Multi-Effect Potions

**Combine 3+ ingredients with overlapping properties:**

**Example:**
- Blue valley Flower (Restore magic, Fortify Health)
- Wheat (Restore Health, Fortify Health)
- Red Mountain Flower (Restore magic, Fortify magic)

**Result: Potion with 3 effects:**
1. Restore Health (from Wheat)
2. Restore magic (from both flowers)
3. Fortify Health (from BMF + Wheat)

**Philosophy:** Experimentation creates powerful custom potions**
