|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Irite** | Hard, heavy, reliable | Mines, surface deposits | General-purpose, high durability |
| **Cobalt** | Dense, impact-resistant | Deep mines, volcanic regions | Blunt weapons, heavy armor |
| **Silverine** | Light, magic-conductive | Crystal caves, enchanted veins | Anti-undead, enchantment base |
| **Ashforged Steel** | Heat-treated, resilient | Volcanic forges, deep earth | Fire resistance, superior tempering |

## Smelting & Refinement

Raw ore must be smelted at a forge to produce ingots. Purity depends on ore quality and Smithing skill:

| Ore Quality | Smithing Skill Required | Resulting Purity |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Rough Ore | 0+ | Crude (T1) |
| Mined Ore | 15+ | Standard (T2) |
| Vein Ore | 35+ | Fine (T3) |
| Deep Ore | 60+ | Pure (T4) |
| Primal Ore | 85+ | Pristine (T5) |

## Alloys

Combining two metal types at the forge creates alloys with blended properties. Requires knowing both base metals.

| Alloy | Components | Properties |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| **Gleamsteel** | Irite + Silverine | Durable + magic-conductive |
| **Cinderplate** | Cobalt + Ashforged Steel | Impact-resistant + heat-treated |
| **Blackband** | Irite + Duskiore | General-purpose + high-damage |
