## Processing Stages

Raw hides must be processed through stages at a tanning rack:

| Stage | Process | Time | Result |
|-------|---------|------|--------|
| **Raw** | Skinning (field) | Immediate | Unprocessed hide, degrades over time |
| **Cured** | Salt-cure at rack | 5 min | Stabilized, won't degrade |
| **Tanned** | Tannin bath | 10 min | Workable leather, standard purity |
| **Treated** | Oil/wax treatment | 15 min | Enhanced properties, fine+ purity |
| **Masterworked** | Expert finishing | 20 min | Peak properties, pure+ purity |

Processing quality depends on Smithing skill (Tanning perks). Higher skill at each stage produces higher effective purity.
