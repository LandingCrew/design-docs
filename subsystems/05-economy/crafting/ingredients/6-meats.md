## Cooking Philosophy

Monster meat is **not immediately edible** — raw monster parts cause negative effects (nausea, poison, stat damage). Proper cooking with the right technique and seasoning neutralizes dangers and unlocks powerful buffs. Higher Alchemy (Cooking) skill = better neutralization, stronger buffs, reduced side effects.
