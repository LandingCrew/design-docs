## Blood Gem Mechanics

- Gems must be **charged** by defeating enemies near an empty gem (ambient soul absorption)
- Charged gems are **crushed** during enchanting to release stored energy
- Gem size determines maximum enchantment strength
- **No moral dilemma** — ambient absorption replaces the soul trap mechanic
- Gems can also be found pre-charged in dungeons and treasure
