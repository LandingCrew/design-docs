## Design Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
1. **Skill Determines Quality** - Master smith > Novice smith with same materials
2. **Progression Gated** - You need to visit a trainer to unlock a perk slot (and have high enough skill)
3. **Discovery Through Experimentation** - Learn by trying, not wiki lookup (you can still wiki lookup)
4. **Late-Game Advantage** - Your crafted gear > found loot at high skill
5. **Meaningful Progression** - Crafting skills synergize with combat builds
6. **NPC services** - you can always ask a crafting npc to temper weapons, brew potions, or refresh an enchantment

**Influences:**
- Skyrim (basic framework)
- Morrowind (alchemy discovery)
- The Witcher 3 (potion preparation)

## Crafting Progression Loop

### Early Game (Skills 1-30)

**Smithing:**
- Craft iron/steel gear (shoddy/standard quality)
- Upgrades to +1 or +2
- Competitive with early loot

**Alchemy:**
- Basic healing potions (12-20 HP)
- Restore stamina/magic
- 1-2 effect potions
- Experimenting with common ingredients

**Enchanting:**
- Weak enchantments (+2-5 damage)

### Mid Game (Skills 30-70)

**Smithing:**
