# Weapon Properties — Smithing Reference

> Physical/mechanical weapon properties relevant to our [Smithing Modifier Tree](../2-crafting-progression.md#smithing---physical--mechanical-modifiers).

## Overview

The D&D MIC contains very few purely physical weapon properties — most are magical (Enchanting). Our Smithing modifier tree **invents original physical modifiers** (Sharp, Keen, Swift, Balanced, etc.) that have no direct D&D equivalent.

The properties below are the closest D&D MIC parallels to physical smithing concepts.

## Physical / Mechanical Properties

| Property | Price | Effect | D&D Source | Our Smithing Modifier |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Collision** | +2 | +5 flat damage (mass increase at impact point) | weapons.md | — (borderline: mass manipulation is somewhat physical) |
| **Disarming** | +2 | +2 disarm bonus, can't be disarmed | weapons.md | — (physical design: jutting prongs and ridges) |
| **Charging** | +1 | +2d6 on mounted charge | weapons.md | — (physical balance for mounted combat) |
| **Chargebreaker** | +1 | Charging creatures knocked prone | weapons.md | — (rounded tip design, like jousting lance) |

## Design Notes

Our Smithing modifier tree creates **original physical properties** that D&D doesn't model well because D&D treats almost everything as magical enhancement. Our system separates:

| Our Smithing Modifiers | Concept | D&D Equivalent |
|-----------------------|---------|----------------|
| **Sharp** | Improved edge quality | Base +1 enhancement |
| **Keen** | Extended crit range | Keen (magical in D&D) |
| **Vorpal** | Devastating crits | Vorpal (magical in D&D) |
| **Swift** | Faster attack speed | No equivalent (D&D doesn't model speed) |
| **Rapid** | Very fast attacks | No equivalent |
| **Balanced** | Reduced stamina cost | No equivalent (D&D doesn't model stamina) |
| **Effortless** | Minimal stamina drain | No equivalent |
| **Weighted** | Stagger on hit | No equivalent (closest: Brutal Surge) |
| **Crushing** | Heavy stagger + knockback | No equivalent |
| **Lightweight** | Reduced weight | Mithral material (not property) |
| **Aerodynamic** | Projectile speed/accuracy | No equivalent |
| **Barbed** | Bleed on hit | No equivalent |
| **Serrated** | Strong bleed on hit | No equivalent |

**Philosophy:** Smithing modifiers represent what a master blacksmith can achieve through **physical craftsmanship** — better edges, superior balance, weight distribution, aerodynamic shaping. These don't require magic, just skill and materials.
