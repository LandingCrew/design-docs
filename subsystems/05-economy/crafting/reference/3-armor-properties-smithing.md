# Armor Properties — Smithing Reference

> Physical/mechanical armor properties relevant to our [Smithing Modifier Tree](../2-crafting-progression.md#smithing---physical--mechanical-modifiers) and [Tanning Modifier Tree](../2-crafting-progression.md#tanning---hide--leather-modifiers).
> Full property details in [armor.md](armor.md) (raw reference).

## Overview

Like weapons, the D&D MIC treats nearly all armor properties as magical. Our system separates physical craftsmanship (Smithing/Tanning) from magical enhancement (Enchanting). The properties below are the closest D&D parallels to physical armor modifications.

---

## Physical / Mechanical Properties

| Property | Price | Effect | D&D Source | Our Modifier |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Blueshine** | 1,500gp | Never tarnishes, acid/rust immune, +2 Hide | armor.md | — (material treatment, borderline) |
| **Buoyant** | 4,000gp | No Swim check penalty, +2 Swim | armor.md | Buoyant (could be smithing: lighter construction) |
| **Easy Travel** | 1,500gp | Medium load as light, extended march | armor.md | Easy Travel (could be smithing: weight distribution) |

## Design Notes

Our Smithing and Tanning modifier trees create **original physical properties** that fill the gap D&D handles with magic:

### Smithing Armor Modifiers

| Our Modifier | Concept | D&D Equivalent |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **Reinforced** | Improved structural integrity | Base +1 enhancement |
| **Fortified** | Maximum durability + DR | Adamantine material |
| **Padded** | Noise-dampened interior | No direct equivalent |
| **Silent** | Near-silent movement | Mithral (reduced penalties) |
| **Fitted** | Custom-fit, reduced penalties | Mithral (reduced penalties) |
| **Ergonomic** | Perfect fit, minimal penalties | No equivalent |
| **Spiked** | Exterior damage spikes | Armor spikes (mundane) |
| **Thorned** | Heavy spikes + grapple bonus | Armor spikes (mundane) |
| **Flexible** | Dodge bonus (light armor) | No equivalent |
| **Supple** | High dodge + no sprint penalty | No equivalent |

### Tanning Armor Modifiers

| Our Modifier | Concept | D&D Equivalent |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **Suppleness** | Reduced check penalty via leather treatment | No equivalent |
| **Greater Suppleness** | Maximum flexibility | No equivalent |
| **Thickness** | Physical DR through layered hide | No equivalent |
| **Greater Thickness** | Maximum physical DR | Adamantine-like |
| **Waterproofing** | Water resistance via wax/oil treatment | Buoyant (loosely) |
| **All-Weather** | Full weather resistance | Deepdweller (loosely, but magical) |
| **Creature Echo** | Source creature property inheritance | Dragonhide material (loosely) |
| **Dragon Treatment** | Elemental resistance from wyrm hide | Dragonhide + resistance |
| **Shadowweave** | Stealth bonus from dark hide treatment | Blueshine (loosely) |
| **Scale Reinforcement** | Hybrid heavy DR / light penalty | No equivalent |
| **Petrified Panels** | Extreme DR + petrify immunity | No equivalent |

**Philosophy:** Smithing and Tanning modifiers represent what master craftspeople achieve through **physical technique** — reinforced joints, custom fitting, layered padding, creature-specific treatments. No magic required, just expertise and the right materials.
