## Tanning - Leatherworking & Hide Processing

> Sub-discipline of **Smithing** (shares Smithing skill level, has own perk branch)
> See [Ingredients - Leather & Hide](ingredients/3-leather-and-hide.md) for material types and processing stages
> See [Crafting Progression - Tanning Modifiers](2-crafting-progression.md#tanning---hide--leather-modifiers) for the modifier tree

### Overview

Tanning covers the processing of raw hides into workable leather and the crafting of medium armor, stealth gear, and leather accessories. It uses the **Smithing skill** for quality calculations but has its own **perk branch** within the Smithing tree for modifier discovery.

**Philosophy:** Leather isn't "worse armor" — it's **different armor**. Leather gear excels at evasion, stealth, flexibility, and specialized resistances. A master tanner's Wyrm Leather armor is as end-game viable as a master smith's Voidmetal plate.

### Processing Pipeline

Raw hides must be processed at a **Tanning Rack** before they can be used:

| Stage | Process | Time | Smithing Skill | Result |
|-------|---------|------|---------------|--------|
| **Raw** | Skinning (field knife) | Immediate | 0 | Unprocessed, degrades in 24 hours |
| **Cured** | Salt-cure at rack | 5 min | 10 | Stabilized, indefinite storage |
| **Tanned** | Tannin bath | 10 min | 25 | Workable leather, Standard purity |
| **Treated** | Oil/wax treatment | 15 min | 50 | Enhanced properties, Fine+ purity |
| **Masterworked** | Expert finishing | 20 min | 75 | Peak properties, Pure+ purity |

Each stage is an opportunity to apply **tanning modifiers** (Suppleness, Thickness, Waterproofing, etc.) that permanently affect the final leather's properties.

### Craftable Items

| Item Type | Materials | Smithing Skill | Notes |
|-----------|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Leather Armor (per piece)** | Tanned Leather (4) | 10+ | Light/medium armor |
| **Leather Accessories** | Tanned Leather (2) | 15+ | Belts, bracers, quivers |
| **Stealth Gear** | Shadowcat Leather (3) | 45+ | Noise-dampened, dark |
| **Scale Armor** | Wyvern Scale (3), Metal (1) | 60+ | Hybrid light/heavy |
| **Exotic Armor** | Wyrm/Basilisk Leather (4) | 85+ | Legendary properties |

Quality follows the same [Skill-Based Quality System](3-Smithing.md#skill-based-quality-system) as metal smithing (Shoddy → Masterwork).

### What Makes Tanning Unique

| Metal Smithing | Tanning |
|---------------|---------|
| High base protection | High evasion and flexibility |
| Heavy, noisy | Light, quiet |
| Universal resistances (plating) | Creature-specific resistances (hide source) |
| Better against sustained damage | Better against burst/avoidable damage |
| Tank/frontline builds | Stealth/ranger/skirmisher builds |

### Modifier Integration

The modifier discovery tree handles all progression depth for Tanning. See [Crafting Progression - Tanning Modifiers](2-crafting-progression.md#tanning---hide--leather-modifiers) for:
- **Treatment modifiers**: Suppleness, Thickness, Waterproofing, All-Weather
- **Exotic treatment modifiers**: Creature Echo, Dragon Treatment, Shadowweave, Scale Reinforcement, Petrified Panels
- Synergy chains and perk gate requirements

---

### Inspiration Notes

- Leather processing is a **real craft** with distinct stages — salt curing, tanning, oiling, finishing
- Exotic creature hides should feel meaningfully different from common leather, not just "better stats"
- Stealth builds should feel **equal** to heavy armor builds, not "lower tier"
- Dungeon Meshi-style creature utilization: every part of the monster has a use
- Tanning rack should feel like a meaningful crafting station, not just "click to convert hide → leather"
