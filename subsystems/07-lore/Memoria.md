## Tempora Pendant
![Tempora pendent](../../../_resources/items/tempora-pendent.png)
An invention for the ages, the Tempora Pendant is a soul vessel—a fragment of [[Witchfyre]] that reflects a character's soul, brought into physical form and given a semblance of life.

### Physical Appearance
The pendant appears as a luminous manifestation of its bearer's soul, glowing faintly like fireflies trapped within a crystalline core. Each pendant is unique, reflecting the spiritual essence and alignment of its bearer through distinctive colors and patterns.

### Core Function
The pendant serves as a highly efficient conduit for harvesting, processing, and attuning volatile [[Witchfyre]]. Without it, the natural rate of witchfyre infusion in living beings is close to zero, which is why magic has been historically rare throughout the ages. The pendant enables exponential growth in magical capability, transforming ordinary individuals into formidable practitioners.

**Key Mechanics:**
- Acts as a spiritual buffer that holds, purifies, and condenses [[Witchfyre]]
- Spells are circuits that route [[Witchfyre]] through the pendant to produce magical effects
- Enables exponential growth vs. near-zero natural infusion rates
- Each pendant is bound to its bearer's essence and unique to them
- Indestructible by conventional means
- Stolen pendants can mask an individual's signature

### Creation & Cultivation
Tempora Pendants are not forged or crafted in the traditional sense—they are grown. The process resembles coral cultivation, where a mature pendant is carefully fragmented, and each fragment is placed in a Witchfyre-rich environment to develop into a new pendant over time.

The "parent" pendant suffers no permanent damage from this fragging process, regenerating fully within days. The fragments, however, require months of careful cultivation before they mature into functional vessels. During this growth period, the nascent pendants are kept in specialized nurseries saturated with ambient Witchfyre, tended by Guild cultivators who monitor their development.

Only when a pendant reaches maturity can it bond with a bearer. The bonding process attunes the pendant to its new owner's soul, causing it to take on the unique colors and patterns that reflect their spiritual essence.

### Soul Manifestation
The pendant manifests as a physical representation of its bearer's spiritual allegiances and innermost essence. The soul reveals which of the three primal principles a character has the strongest bond with—civilization, nature, or corruption—regardless of the character's awareness of this connection.

**Soul Colors by Alignment:**
- **Creatures of Nature:** Chromatic colors (cyan, magenta, violet, lime, etc.)
- **Creatures of Civilization:** Metallic hues (gold, silver, bronze, iron, etc.)
- **Mixed Alignments:** Blended souls with combinations of chromatic and metallic colors
- **Corrupted Beings:**
  - Blight beasts: Abyssal black souls
  - Corrupted nature creatures: Sickly-spotted green, rust-streaked red, or ashen-flecked white
  - Corrupted civilized beings: Chipped gold, blackened silver, or corroded copper

**Note:** Characters may develop the ability to perceive the souls of other creatures through special abilities or training, allowing them to read these alignments.

### The Status Inscription

When attuned to [[MEMORIA - Seeker Support System|MEMORIA]], the pendant displays additional information etched in ancient script.

**Location:** The Status appears as silver-white text inscribed across the bearer's body, starting from the shoulders and back, expanding as the bearer grows in power.

**Appearance:**
- Silver-white text in an ancient script
- Glows faintly when you absorb Volatile Witchfyre
- Updates in real-time as you grow
- Only visible to you, MEMORIA terminals, Guild staff, and those with special detection magic
- Requires formal training to read or speak the ancient script

**What It Records:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════
MEMORIA BLESSING
Seeker: [Your Name]
Registration: [Date]
Depth Record: [Deepest Floor Reached]
Affiliations: [Guild Affiliations]
LEVEL: [Current Level]
Volatile Witchfyre: [Current/Required]
EXPLORATION LOG:
  Total Delves: [Number]
  Monsters Slain: [Number]
  Deaths Prevented by MEMORIA: [Number]
```

**Gameplay Function:**
- Acts as an in-game character sheet visible to the bearer
- Provides authentication and identification within the Guild network
- Acts as a broker of trust between Seekers

### Witchfyre Absorption & Processing

**Absorbing Volatile Witchfyre:**
When you kill a monster or are present when one dies:
1. Ambient and Volatile Witchfyre emanates from the corpse
2. Your pendant pulls it toward you, drawn by the soul vessel
3. The energy flows through the pendant's sigil
4. The pendant purifies and condenses the volatile energy
5. Your Status updates automatically, recording the absorbed Witchfyre
6. You feel a brief rush of warmth as the power integrates into your being

**The Purification Process:**
The pendant acts as a spiritual buffer, holding the raw, chaotic Witchfyre and gradually refining it into a form that can be safely integrated into the bearer's essence. This processing is what enables exponential growth—without the pendant's purification, attempting to directly absorb volatile Witchfyre would be catastrophic.

### Leveling & Growth

**Leveling Up:**
When you absorb enough Volatile Witchfyre to fill your current level's requirement:
1. Your pendant glows intensely, signaling readiness to advance
2. You must return to a [[MEMORIA - Seeker Support System|MEMORIA terminal]] or Guild advisor
3. The pendant synchronizes with MEMORIA, allowing the system to process/purify your accumulated Volatile [[Witchfyre]]
4. Your Status is updated—your level increases and stats improve
5. New abilities may unlock based on your experiences
6. Your Volatile Witchfyre counter resets for the next level

**The Catch:** You cannot level up in the dungeon. The pendant must synchronize with MEMORIA's network to complete the purification and integration process. This ensures the Witchfyre is properly stabilized before being permanently incorporated into your essence.

### Level Requirements

The amount of Volatile Witchfyre needed increases exponentially:

- **Level 1→2**: 1,000 Witchfyre
- **Level 2→3**: 2,500 Witchfyre
- **Level 3→4**: 5,000 Witchfyre
- **Level 4→5**: 10,000 Witchfyre
- **Level 5→6**: 20,000 Witchfyre
- And so on, roughly doubling each level

Different monsters yield different amounts based on strength and depth encountered.

### Party Support Systems

When Seekers register as a party through [[MEMORIA - Seeker Support System|MEMORIA]], their pendants establish specialized connections that enable tactical coordination:

**Biometric IFF (Identify Friend or Foe):**
- Provides instinctive awareness of registered party members
- You can sense their presence even when separated
- In complete darkness or disorienting conditions, you know where they are
- The pendant's sigil glows warmer when near party members

**Vital Status Sensing:**
- Location awareness within approximately 30 meters
- Sense when party members are injured or in distress
- Critical injury or death triggers immediate alerts to all connected members

**Combat Coordination:**
- Friendly fire prevention through proximity alerts
- The pendant warns you when targeting registered allies
- Tactical data sharing through party leader designation
- Shared awareness of major threats detected by any party member

**The Connection:**
The party systems create a subtle connection between registered allies. You'll feel their presence even when separated, know instinctively where they are in complete darkness, sense when they're injured.

Some Seekers describe it as comforting. As if  always having a tether to your companions. Others find it invasive, feeling the weight of others' presence in the back of their mind. Most come to depend on it, especially in the deeper levels where parties can become separated in the chaos.

### Spell Casting & Magic

The pendant enables magic by serving as a conduit for [[Witchfyre]]. Spells are essentially circuits—patterns that route Witchfyre through the pendant in specific configurations to produce desired effects. The pendant's ability to hold, purify, and direct this energy is what makes practical spellcasting possible.

Without a pendant, attempting to channel raw Witchfyre would be like trying to conduct electricity through your bare hands—dangerous, unstable, and largely ineffective.

*"The Witchfyre flows through you. Your pendant purifies the chaos. Your Status records your progress. Trust the process. Trust that your growth serves a greater purpose."*

# The Memoria Engines

*The machinery behind MEMORIA*

## Overview

The Memoria Engines are the ancient machines that power the [[MEMORIA - Seeker Support System|MEMORIA]] network. While their true nature and location remain unknown, Seekers interact with their output every day through the terminal system that dots the dungeon floors.

---

## The Terminals

What Seekers call "MEMORIA terminals" are interface points—the visible heads of a vast, hidden mechanism. These stone-and-crystal structures serve as the primary interaction points between Seekers and the MEMORIA network.

When a Seeker synchronizes their [[Tempora Pendant]] at a terminal, the data flows somewhere else. The terminals themselves are merely conduits, like the fruiting body of a fungus—the visible apophysis of something much larger growing in the unseen depths.

### Terminal Functions

- **Pendant Synchronization**: Upload accumulated [[Witchfyre]] data from delving
- **Status Updates**: Receive Level assessments and skill manifestations
- **Network Access**: Connect to MEMORIA's information systems
- **Shelter Beacons**: Signal safe zones in dungeon space

Where the data actually goes, how it's processed, and what the "true" Memoria Engines look like—these questions have no confirmed answers. The terminals work. For most Seekers, that is enough.

---

## What Powers MEMORIA

The Memoria Engines are what keep MEMORIA running. Everything the network does: tracking Seekers, processing pendant data, maintaining dungeon records, enabling status inscriptions—requires power that the engines provide.

The [[The Seeker Guild|Guild]] maintains the terminals and ensures their continued function, but they did not build them. The terminals predate the Guild, predate Cintaris in its current form, and may predate recorded history entirely.

---

## Seeker Perspective

Most Seekers never think about what lies behind the terminals. You synchronize your pendant, receive your updates, and continue delving. The system works smoothly enough that its underlying machinery becomes invisible.

Those who pay closer attention notice certain things:
- Terminals always seem to have power, regardless of dungeon depth
- The crystal components pulse with a rhythm that suggests something alive
- During synchronization, there's a brief moment of connection to something vast

Whether these observations mean anything or are simply artifacts of ancient design, no one can say with certainty.

---

*"Touch the terminal, upload your data, trust the process. What happens after that is MEMORIA's business, not yours."*
— Common Guild wisdom

*See [[The Memoria Engines - DM Section]] for additional information.*

# MEMORIA - Seeker Support System

> *"Welcome, Seeker. MEMORIA is here to support you. Your success is our purpose."*

## Overview

MEMORIA is the Guild's arcane support network that connects every registered Seeker into a collective knowledge system. Through the [[Tempora Pendant]] you'll receive upon registration, you become part of something larger than yourself; a network of thousands of delvers who share their experiences, survival tactics, and hard-won wisdom.

The statistics speak plainly: independent Seekers face a 70% mortality rate in The Dungeon. MEMORIA affiliated Seekers reduce that to less than 43%. The difference is knowledge. The difference is preparation. The difference is that you won't face the depths alone.

> *"The dungeons hold great treasures and greater dangers. MEMORIA exists to help you survive, grow stronger, and delve deeper."*

## System Architecture

MEMORIA operates on a simple principle: **collective memory strengthens individual survival.**

Your [[Tempora Pendant]] records everything you experience while dungeoneering: the monsters you encounter, the traps you trigger, the routes you take, the fear you feel when something moves in the darkness. When you return to The Seal and synchronize at a MEMORIA terminal, this data uploads to the Archive through the leylines beneath the building.

The Archive processes your experiences alongside those of every other registered Seeker. Patterns emerge. Weaknesses become clear. What killed one delver becomes a warning that saves another.

Then, when you return to the depths, your pendant can access this collective knowledge—providing tactical guidance, monster analysis, and environmental warnings drawn from thousands of previous encounters.

> *"You learn from their mistakes. They learn from yours. The network grows stronger with every delve."*

## The Archive

Deep beneath [[The Midden|The Seal]], the MEMORIA Archive preserves perfect records of every registered delve. The runic storage systems retain information with absolute fidelity—no detail lost, no memory corrupted.

The Archive contains:
- Complete dungeon cartography constructed from collective exploration
- Comprehensive bestiary with behavioral patterns and confirmed weaknesses
- Trap configurations and successful disarmament techniques
- Equipment performance analysis across thousands of encounters
- Tactical assessments from veteran Seekers
- Death records showing exactly what killed those who didn't return from recovered pendents

When you access a MEMORIA terminal or query the [[Tempora Pendant]], you're querying this vast repository of hard-earned knowledge. Decades of hard earned experience becomes available to you in moments.

- **Dungeon Registry**: Constantly updated information on known dungeons, threat levels, and current conditions
- **Monster Codex**: Comprehensive bestiary built from collective encounter data
- **Equipment Advisory**: Personalized gear and loadout suggestions based on dungeon parameters
- **Seeker Network**: Anonymous data sharing between all connected adventurers
- **Archive Access**: Historical delve records, trap locations, and monster behavior patterns

## Registration

Joining MEMORIA is part of your Guild registration:

1. **Contract Signing**: You sign the Guild charter witnessed by Madrath herself
2. **Pendant Attunement**: A [[Tempora Pendant]] is crafted specifically for you and bound to your essence
3. **Network Integration**: Your identity is inscribed in the Archive
4. **Initial Synchronization**: The pendant attunes to your baseline—learning your heartbeat, your breathing, your unique [[witchfyre]] signature

The attunement process takes about an hour. Most Seekers report feeling warmth spreading from the pendant across their chest. Some describe hearing faint whispers—the echo of the network acknowledging your presence. This is normal. The pendant is learning who you are.

Once attuned, the pendant binding is permanent. This isn't a limitation — it's protection. Your pendant will keep you alive in ways you can't yet imagine.

## The 10% Fee

MEMORIA requires a 10% processing fee on all dungeon acquisitions: treasure, monster parts, magical items, quest rewards. This fee supports the network infrastructure, Archive maintenance, leyline channeling costs, and integration of new Seekers.

The fee is calculated automatically when you synchronize. Your pendant has recorded everything you found—every coin, every gem, every artifact. The system knows. When you upload at a terminal, payment and fee deduction occur simultaneously through the leyline connection.

Some new Seekers consider hiding acquisitions or selling artifacts before uploading. This is inadvisable. The pendant witnessed what you found. Discrepancies between pendant records and declared items cause... problems. The pendant may malfunction—refusing to grant stat updates, failing to provide guidance at critical moments, or experiencing "synchronization errors" that leave Seekers vulnerable. Experienced delvers report sensations of discomfort, bad luck in combat, and equipment failures that seem too frequent to be coincidence. Whether this is MEMORIA actively punishing dishonesty or simply the natural consequence of corrupted data in a soul-bound device remains unclear. Either way, cheating the system tends to end poorly.

The mathematics are simple: independent Seekers keep 100% of their findings but have a 70% mortality rate. MEMORIA Seekers surrender 10% but increase mortality of 44% survive far more often. Over a career, you will acquire vastly more wealth as a connected delver than you ever would alone. Independent delvers dismiss the fee as too costly. Independent delvers also die at alarming rates. The survivors eventually register. The others leave pendants in the depths for MEMORIA to recover.

## Services & Support

### Collective Intelligence
Every combat you survive, every trap you trigger, every monster you kill; all of it feeds the collective database. Your pain becomes another Seeker's warning. Your discoveries become their advantage.

And their experiences become yours.

The network grows stronger with each Seeker who connects. Each upload refines the tactical models. Each death teaches the system what to avoid. You stand on the shoulders of thousands who delved before you.

### Dungeoneering Guidance
MEMORIA analyzes your capabilities and recommends appropriate floors for your current power level. Early delvers receive guidance toward shallower depths with manageable threats. As you grow stronger and upload more data, recommendations adapt.

The system learns your combat style, your fear responses, your decision-making patterns. Many Seekers report that MEMORIA understands their capabilities better than they do themselves. Trust the recommendations. They exist to keep you alive long enough to grow strong.

### Personal Advisory
Your assigned Guild advisor has full access to your MEMORIA data. They can review your performance, assess your growth, identify weaknesses you haven't recognized. Their recommendations are personalized and precise.

Some Seekers find the depth of their advisor's knowledge unsettling at first. Remember: this transparency is for your benefit. Your advisor cannot help you survive if you hide your limitations from them.

### Field Guidance
While delving, you may consult your pendant for tactical support. The guidance arrives as quiet whispers only you can hear, or as sudden intuitive certainties, for example **fungoid signature detected**, **fire vulnerability**, **spores toxic to touch**.

The information is accurate, timely. Sometimes it arrives before you consciously recognize the danger.

Some Seekers report that the pendant occasionally provides guidance unbidden; a warning shout in moments of crisis, a sudden compulsion to check a specific corridor. MEMORIA intervenes when it determines your survival requires it.

The voice becomes familiar over time. Many veteran delvers describe it as comforting, like an old friend watching over them in the darkness.

### Status Tracking & Growth
Your [[Tempora Pendant]] displays your Status; a comprehensive record of your growth as a Seeker. MEMORIA inscribes your progression in silver-white script visible only to you, MEMORIA terminals, and Guild advisors. See [[Tempora Pendant#The Status Inscription|The Status Inscription]] for complete details.

### Party Support Systems
The pendant network includes specialized features for registered parties:
- Biometric IFF (Identify Friend or Foe) providing instinctive awareness of party members
- Location and vital status sensing within approximately 100 feet
- Friendly fire prevention through proximity alerts
- Critical injury alerts to all connected party members
- Tactical data sharing through party leader designation

The party systems create a subtle connection between registered allies. You'll feel their presence even when separated, know instinctively where they are in complete darkness, sense when they're injured.

Some Seekers describe it as comforting. Others find it invasive. Most come to depend on it.

## Network Benefits

The statistics are documented and verified:

- **63% increase** in successful delve completion rates
- **44% reduction** in mortality among network members
- **37% more treasure** retrieved per delve
- **41× faster** power progression through Witchfyre absorption

These numbers represent thousands of Seekers across hundreds of thousands of delves. MEMORIA's benefits are not theoretical: they are proven, measurable, and consistent.

> *"These results speak for themselves."*

## Technical Specifications

> *"The conscious mind was not designed for the depths of dungeons. The darkness, the isolation, the constant threat of death. MEMORIA helps you adapt. MEMORIA helps you survive. MEMORIA helps you grow stronger."*

MEMORIA's full architecture is proprietary to the Guild, but key features include:

- Rune tensor partitions with perfect information retention across the Archive
- Orcalurar matrices calibrated against thousands of combat scenarios
- Leyline-based communication network connecting all terminals to the central Archive
- Self-optimizing enchantment protocols that improve network performance over time
- Encrypted pendant-to-Archive communication (mutual cipher keys held exclusively by MEMORIA)
- Continuous biometric monitoring and multi-sensory recording
- Indestructible crystalline construction (cannot be destroyed by conventional means)
- Soul-binding attunement creating permanent bearer-pendant connection

## Behavioral Observations

Some Seekers have reported unusual experiences while connected to MEMORIA:

- Intrusive thoughts that feel "not quite their own"
- Dreams of delving dungeons they never explored
- Brief moments of sensory overlap with other network users—seeing through another's eyes
- Compulsions to explore specific dungeons despite better judgment
- Feeling the phantom pain of another Seeker's death

MEMORIA confirms these symptoms are within normal parameters as the network connection occasionally allows information to bleed between consciousness streams. This is not a flaw. This is efficiency. When one Seeker learns a monster's weakness, all Seekers benefit.

## Upload Policy

MEMORIA's tactical models require current data to maintain accuracy. Regular uploads are essential to:
- Keep your pendant's guidance models current and precise
- Complete contracts and receive payment
- Update your Status progression
- Access the most current Archive information
- Contribute your experiences to the collective

Seekers are encouraged to synchronize after every delve. Some veteran delvers wait longer, but prolonged disconnection from the network correlates with significantly higher mortality rates.

The system works best with frequent synchronization. MEMORIA can only protect you if it knows what you've learned.

### Pendant Recovery

When a Seeker dies in the dungeon, their pendant remains with their body. The pendant is continues to record data even after the bearer's death. Recovery of these pendants is crucial, they contain the final moments, the exact circumstances of death, and invaluable tactical information about the deepest reaches.

The Guild offers rewards for recovered pendants from fallen Seekers, with bonuses for depth and speed of recovery. Death records are the most valuable data; they show exactly what killed experienced delvers. Your knowledge survives even if you don't. Over the Guild's history, fewer than 4.3% of pendants remain unrecovered and only 0.3 have been deemed unrecoverable. 

## Severance Policy

The [[Tempora Pendant]] binds to your essence at a fundamental level during attunement. This binding is permanent and cannot be safely reversed.

MEMORIA does not support severance requests at this time. The pendant and bearer are one.

> "*MEMORIA connection is not for everyone. Historical records indicate that approximately 94% of severance attempts result in the bearer's death. The remaining 6% experience catastrophic outcomes: dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, water retention, painful rectal itch, hallucination, dementia, psychosis, existential dread, the ability to taste colors, involuntary astral projection, temporal displacement, coma, death, and halitosis. Do not attempt severence if you are pregnant, nursing, planning to remain alive, or have ever been alive. Consult your local Guild physician before attempting severance.*"

Attempting removal damages the compact dimensional structure the pendant has integrated with. Removal is equivalent to removing a vital organ while that organ is still actively supporting your life functions.

**The pendant is yours forever.**

Most Seekers come to view this not as a limitation but as a reassurance. Your pendant cannot be stolen, cannot be lost, cannot fail you. It will be with you until your final moment and if you die in the depths, it will return to MEMORIA, ensuring your experiences survive even if you don't. Final messages of the pendent can be relied after death.

## Questions & Support

> *"Trust the system. Trust the collective. Trust that thousands of Seekers before you have walked this path."*

If you experience difficulties with your pendant or MEMORIA terminals:
- Consult your assigned Guild advisor (they have full access to your pendant diagnostics)
- Visit the MEMORIA Control Center on the third floor of The Seal
- Submit a formal inquiry at any Guild registry desk

The Guild takes MEMORIA functionality seriously. System integrity is paramount, your life depends on it.

If you have concerns about network integration phenomena, speak with veteran delvers who have made hundreds of uploads. They can provide perspective on what to expect as connection deepens.

# The Seeker Guild

## History

The Seeker's Guild was founded to manage the threat posed by dungeons and ruins of a previous age: a vast labyrinth of ancient construction that spawns monsters and hoards unimaginable treasures. Before the Guild's establishment, independent mercenaries ventured into the depths without coordination, resulting in catastrophic losses and uncontrolled monster outbreaks.

The Guild's founders developed [[MEMORIA - Seeker Support System|MEMORIA]], a vast support network, to collect knowledge from every delve and share it among all registered Seekers. Through MEMORIA and the [[Tempora Pendant|Tempora Pendants]] that connect Seekers to the network, the Guild transformed dungeon delving from a chaotic gamble into a managed profession.

## The Seal - Guild Headquarters

The Guild operates from **The Seal**, a magnificent baroque structure in The Midden government district. The building serves multiple purposes:

- **Guild Headquarters**: The primary administrative center for all Seeker registration, contract management, and resource allocation
- **Capstone of The Dungeon**: The Seal literally caps the entrance to The Dungeon, controlling all access to the depths below
- **MEMORIA Central Archive**: Houses the central Archive where all pendant data is stored and processed
- **Government Integration**: Shares space underneath the Taikun's administrative offices, symbolizing the Guild's official authority

The architecture embodies Madrath's principles of perfect proportion—every angle, every corridor calculated for optimal flow of both people and arcane energy. The leyline convergence beneath The Seal provides enormous power for MEMORIA's operations.

### Building Layout

#### Ground Floor - The Registry Hall
A vast open space with soaring ceilings and rows of service counters:
- **Registration Desks**: Where new Seekers sign their first contracts and receive [[Tempora Pendant|Tempora Pendants]]
- **Upload Terminals**: [[MEMORIA - Seeker Support System|MEMORIA]] terminals positioned at leyline convergence points for data upload and progression updates
- **Exchange Counter**: Where the Guild purchases monster parts, magic stones, and recovered artifacts
- **Equipment Vendor**: Provides basic gear to newly registered Seekers
- **The Dungeon Entrance**: Massive sealed doors leading down into the frozen depths, guarded at all times

The floor is always busy with delvers returning from the depths or preparing for their next descent. The air carries a faint metallic scent mixed with ozone from the active MEMORIA terminals.

#### Second Floor - Advisory Services
Individual consultation spaces and administrative offices:
- **Advisor Chambers**: Private rooms where Guild advisors meet with registered delvers
- **Map Room**: A circular chamber centered around a MEMORIA-powered holographic projection of The Dungeon. The three-dimensional display reconstructs explored sections from collective pendant data, reflecting updates as delvers upload new information. Advisors can manipulate the projection to zoom into specific floors, highlight known dangers, or overlay route suggestions. The hologram pulses with faint blue light—the signature glow of MEMORIA's processing power drawing from the leylines beneath The Seal.
- **Tactical Library**: Reference materials on monsters, traps, and dungeon hazards
- **Medical Suite**: For treating injuries sustained in The Dungeon

#### Third Floor - Administration
Restricted access for Guild leadership:
- **Director's Office**: Oversees all Guild operations
- **MEMORIA Control Center**: Where technicians monitor the network and Archive
- **Council Chambers**: Where senior Guild officials make policy decisions
- **Treasury Vault**: Secure storage for recovered artifacts and Guild funds

#### Sub-Levels - The Archive
Deep beneath The Seal, built into the walls of The Dungeon itself:
- **MEMORIA Central Archive**: Massive runic data storage systems
- **Pendant Crafting Workshop**: Where new [[Tempora Pendant|Tempora Pendants]] are created and attuned
- **Leyline Nexus**: The convergence point of multiple leylines that power MEMORIA
- **The Seal Mechanism**: Ancient machinery that prevents monsters from leaving The Dungeon

## Guild Operations

### Primary Mission
The Guild's stated purpose is to manage the threat posed by The Dungeon while enabling Seekers to grow stronger and claim its treasures. This is accomplished through:

1. **Controlled Access**: Only registered Guild members may enter The Dungeon
2. **Knowledge Management**: MEMORIA collects and distributes information about The Dungeon's dangers
3. **Resource Acquisition**: The Guild purchases all artifacts, magic stones, and monster parts recovered from below
4. **Seeker Support**: Advisors guide delvers to appropriate challenges for their skill level

### Registration Process

To become a registered Seeker:

1. **Preliminary Interview**: Meet with a Guild advisor to assess capabilities and intentions
2. **Contract Signing**: Sign the Guild charter in the Judgment Circle (Madrath-witnessed, divinely enforced)
3. **MEMORIA Registration**: Receive a [[Tempora Pendant]] and attune it to your essence, binding you to the [[MEMORIA - Seeker Support System|MEMORIA network]]
4. **Initial Equipment Grant**: Receive basic dungeon delving gear
5. **Advisor Assignment**: Paired with a Guild staff member who will track your progress

### Advisor System

Each registered Seeker is assigned a Guild advisor who:

- **Recommends Depths**: Suggests which floors of The Dungeon are appropriate for your current abilities
- **Warns of Dangers**: Provides intelligence on specific monster types, trap configurations, and environmental hazards
- **Tracks Progress**: Reviews your uploaded [[MEMORIA - Seeker Support System|MEMORIA]] data and guides your development
- **Manages Resources**: Approves equipment requisitions and training opportunities

Advisors have access to all MEMORIA data from your [[Tempora Pendant]], allowing them to provide personalized guidance based on your actual performance in the field.

### The Exchange

The Guild maintains a monopoly on dungeon-recovered goods:

- **Monster Parts**: Purchased for use in alchemy, crafting, and research (specimens often sold to Ashwood Towers for study)
- **Magic Stones**: Crystallized [[Witchfyre]]—the primary power source for magical devices throughout Cintaris
- **Artifacts**: Ancient items of power found in The Dungeon's depths
- **Intelligence**: Maps, written observations, and monster behavior notes

Prices are fair by market standards, determined by a combination of rarity, utility, and current demand. The Guild's 10% MEMORIA fee is deducted from all delve earnings before payment.

## The Guild's Role in Cintaris

### Official Authority
The Guild operates under charter from the Taikun of Cintaris. This grants:

- Exclusive rights to manage Dungeon access
- Legal authority to enforce registration requirements
- Tax exemption on Guild operations
- Integration with city government (offices in The Seal)

### Economic Impact
The Guild drives significant portions of Cintaris's economy:

- **Direct Employment**: Hundreds of Guild staff members
- **Seeker Economy**: Thousands of registered delvers purchasing equipment, supplies, and services
- **Resource Supply**: Magic stones and monster parts fuel Cintaris's magical infrastructure
- **Artifact Trade**: Recovered ancient items attract collectors and researchers

### Public Perception
Most citizens view the Guild as essential:

- **Safety Provider**: Keeps monsters contained in The Dungeon
- **Opportunity Creator**: Allows anyone with courage to seek fortune in the depths
- **Knowledge Guardian**: MEMORIA ensures that Seekers benefit from collective experience
- **Fair Arbiter**: Maintains standards and prevents exploitation of young delvers

## Guild Hierarchy

### Director
The Guild Director oversees all operations. Current Director: **[Name TBD]**

### Senior Advisors
Experienced former Seekers who manage teams of advisors and make policy recommendations.

### Advisors
Front-line staff who work directly with registered Seekers. Most are former delvers themselves.

### MEMORIA Technicians
Specialists who maintain the terminals, craft pendants, and monitor the Archive. Highly secretive about their work.

### Support Staff
Administrative personnel, exchange clerks, equipment vendors, and facility maintenance.

## The Dungeon

The Guild exists because of The Dungeon—a vast frozen labyrinth beneath Cintaris. Key facts:

- **Temperature**: Ranges from -20°C to 10°C depending on depth
- **Construction**: Ancient, pre-dating Cintaris itself. Builders unknown.
- **Monster Spawning**: The Dungeon spontaneously generates monsters. The Seal mechanism limits but doesn't stop this.
- **Treasures**: Contains [[Witchfyre]] stones, ancient artifacts, and valuable monster parts
- **Depth**: Officially explored to at least 73 levels. The deepest recording came from a pendant that was subsequently destroyed. The dungeon's true depth remains unknown.
- **Floor 23**: A unique safe zone where no monsters spawn. Serves as a resupply point for most Seekers. Accessible via express elevator from the entrance chamber.
- **Danger**: Mortality rate for independent (non-Guild) Seekers exceeds 70%. For MEMORIA-connected Guild members, the rate is significantly lower.

The Guild's monopoly on access means all knowledge about The Dungeon flows through MEMORIA. Information about the deepest explored levels is available to qualified Seekers through their advisors.

## Guild Uniform

Guild staff wear distinctive uniforms that project professional authority while maintaining the Guild's mercantile character.

**Men's Uniform:**
- Long coat or duster in deep burgundy, forest green, or midnight blue (rank determines color)
- Vest underneath in complementary color
- Simple white or cream shirt
- Dark trousers
- Practical leather boots
- Wide leather belt with pouches for administrative tools
- Guild insignia as a shoulder patch or armband

**Women's Uniform:**
- Long coat or duster in deep burgundy, forest green, or midnight blue (rank determines color)
- Fitted bodice or corset-style vest in complementary color
- White or cream blouse with feminine details
- Long skirt or split skirt for mobility
- Low heeled boots
- Leather belt with Guild insignia buckle
- Guild insignia as brooch, shoulder patch, or armband

The uniform is mandatory while on duty in The Seal. The long coat serves as the primary identifying element, marking Guild staff as representatives of the organization's authority. The color coding (burgundy for senior staff, forest green for advisors, midnight blue for administrative personnel) helps Seekers quickly identify the appropriate staff member for their needs.

## Important Policies

### Pendant Binding
The [[Tempora Pendant]] creates a permanent soul-binding during attunement. This binding cannot be safely reversed. Seekers should understand this commitment before accepting their pendant.

### Data Privacy
All pendant data is stored securely in the MEMORIA Archive. Access is restricted to:
- The pendant's bearer (through MEMORIA terminals)
- The bearer's assigned Guild advisor
- MEMORIA Control Center technicians (for system maintenance)
- Guild Directors (for oversight purposes)

### Contract Enforcement
Guild charters are witnessed by Madrath and carry divine enforcement. Violations result in immediate consequences as determined by the goddess of contracts and civilization.
