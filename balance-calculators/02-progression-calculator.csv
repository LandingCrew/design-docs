LUCK (Universal)
Formula: NORM.DIST(skills_invested, AVERAGE(stats), STDEV(stats), FALSE) × 100

Luck rewards SKILL DIVERSITY:
- More skills invested = Higher luck
- Balanced stat distribution = Higher luck
- Min-maxing (few skills high variance stats) = Lower luck

Examples:
Jack-of-all-trades (15 skills): High luck (~8-12)
Focused build (6-8 skills): Medium luck (~4-7)
Pure specialist (3-4 skills): Low luck (~1-3)

Affected by: Number of different skills with points + stat balance
Not affected by: Total points allocated or skill levels

=== LOGARITHMIC SCALING EXAMPLES ===
Shows how stat gains diminish at higher skill levels

Skill Level,ln(skill+1),Major (×10),Greater (×6.18),Lesser (×3.82),Minor (×2.36)
0,0.00,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1,0.69,6.9,4.3,2.6,1.6
5,1.79,17.9,11.1,6.8,4.2
10,2.40,24.0,14.8,9.2,5.7
25,3.26,32.6,20.1,12.5,7.7
50,3.93,39.3,24.3,15.0,9.3
75,4.33,43.3,26.8,16.5,10.2
100,4.62,46.2,28.5,17.6,10.9

Notice: First 25 points give 32.6 stat (70% of max)
Next 75 points only give 13.6 stat (30% of max)
This encourages broad skill investment over min-maxing

=== CHARACTER XP LEVELING ===

How Character Levels Work:
- Gain character XP from quests discoveries kills etc.
- Level up when XP threshold reached
- Each level: +15 skill points +5 HP +3 SP
- Every 5 levels: Choose bonus (+50 HP/SP OR +1 perk)

Character XP Sources:
Source,XP Amount,Notes
Discovering new location,50-500,Major locations more XP
Learning new spell,100-500,Higher tier = more XP
Reading skill book,200,First time only
Completing quest (minor),500-1000,Side quests
Completing quest (major),2000-5000,Main/faction quests
Passing dialogue check,50-200,Skill-based choices
First kill (enemy type),100-500,Each unique enemy type
Killing nemesis,1000+,Procedural enemies
Boss kill,2000-10000,Major encounters
First craft (item type),50-200,Each unique item type (exponential decay)

XP to Next Level (estimated):
Current Level,XP This Level,Cumulative XP,Notes
1,1000,1000,Starting level
5,2000,7000,Early game
10,3500,20000,Mid-early
15,5000,40000,Mid game
20,7000,70000,Mid-late
25,9000,110000,Your level
30,11000,160000,Late game
40,15000,290000,Very late
50,20000,490000,Endgame

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
1. Set your Character Level (B5)
2. Allocate skill points to skills (column B rows 16-35)
3. Stats auto-calculate in DERIVED STATS section
4. Resource pools auto-calculate in RESOURCE POOLS section
5. Track perk progression in PERK ALLOCATION section
6. Plan Destiny perks in DESTINY PERKS section

=== KEY CHANGES IN V4.0 ===
✓ Logarithmic scaling: stat = coefficient × ln(skill + 1)
✓ New coefficients: Major (10) Greater (6.18) Lesser (3.82) Minor (2.36)
✓ Diminishing returns: Early skill points matter most
✓ Encourages diverse builds over min-maxing single skills
✓ All formulas work out-of-the-box in Excel/Google Sheets
✓ Auto-calculations for stats resources and perk availability
