=== OVERCAP ANALYSIS ===,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
What happens when you exceed caps?,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Stat,Overcap Behavior,Wasted Investment?,Notes
Armor Reduction,Capped at 80%,"Yes, 400+ armor wasted",Stop at 400 armor

,,,,,,,
IMPORTANT: Most caps are HARD CAPS,,,,,,,
"- You cannot exceed the cap value, even temporarily",,,,,,,
"- Buffs/potions that would push you over cap are wasted",,,,,,
"- Plan builds to stay 5-10% below cap for buff flexibility",,,,,,
,,,,,,,
=== ANTI-CAP DESIGN ===,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Mechanics that prevent reaching caps too easily,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
MUTUAL EXCLUSIVITY,,,,,,,
Mechanic,Effect,Why?,,
Heavy Armor + Light Armor,"Cannot wear both, limits armor cap",Forces specialization,,
Fire Resist + Frost Resist,"Hard to max both, gear conflicts",Choose vulnerabilities,,
Physical + Magical builds,"Stat spread limits both Power stats",Hybrid penalty,,
Offense + Defense,"Stats compete, limits both",Glass cannon vs tank,,
,,,,,,,
OPPORTUNITY COSTS,,,,,,,
Investment,Sacrifice,Trade-off,,
400 Armor (80% reduction),Low Agility/Dexterity,"Slow, low crit, poor actions",,
150 Agility (50% movement),Low Strength/Endurance,"Low damage, low HP",,
200+ Crit Investment,Low Endurance/Int,"Fragile, low magic",,
All resistances,Poor offensive stats,"Cannot kill fast",,
,,,,,,,
GEAR LIMITATIONS,,,,,,,
Limitation,Effect,Cap Impact,,
Armor slots (7 total),"Limited enchantment slots, cannot max all resists",Prevents 80% all resists,,
Weapon slots (2H or 1H+Shield),"Shield gives armor, 2H gives damage",Offense vs defense,,
Ring/Amulet limit (2+1),"Limited utility slots, prioritize bonuses",Cannot stack everything,,
Weight limits,"Heavy armor slows, light armor fragile",Mobility vs protection,,

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===,,,,,,,
1. Use this as reference when planning builds,,,,,,,
2. Check breakpoints before heavy stat investment,,,,,,,
3. Stop investing when approaching caps (5-10% below),,,,,,,
4. Identify wasted stats in overcapped areas,,,,,,,
5. Balance multiple stats instead of maxing one,,,,,,,
6. Consider opportunity costs of cap-chasing,,,,,,,
