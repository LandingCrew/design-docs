"5. Block when stamina recovering (5 SP per block)",,,,,,,
6. Repeat,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
SP per Rotation: ~130 SP,,,,,,,
Rotation Time: ~8 seconds,,,,,,,
SP Regen During: 80 SP,,,,,,,
Net SP: -50 SP per rotation,,,,,,,
Rotations Before Empty: ~12 rotations (~96 seconds of combat),,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
MAGE BUILD:,,,,,,,
"1. Cast prepared spell (infinite, but failure chance)",,,,,,,
