,,,,,,,,,
12. DEBUFF RESISTANCE,,,,,,,,,
Formula,"(End×0.5) + (Int×0.3) + (Social×0.2)",,,,,,
Calculation,40 + 12 + 6 = 58,,,,,,
Debuff Duration Mult,0.884×,"=1.0 - (58/500) = shorter debuffs",,,,,,
Effect Range,1.0× to 0.20×,"At 0 to 400 Debuff Resistance",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Debuff Resistance Tiers:,,,,,,,,,
0 Resistance,1.0× duration,"No resistance (full duration)",,,,,,

300 Resistance,0.40× duration,"-60% duration",,,,,,
400 Resistance,0.20× duration,"-80% duration (cap)",,,,,,
Your Resistance:,58 (0.884×),"-11.6% debuff duration",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Practical Examples:,,,,,,,,,
"Poison (10 sec baseline):",8.84 sec,"=10×0.884",,,,,,
"Stun (3 sec baseline):",2.65 sec,"=3×0.884",,,,,,

"Social Standing (×0.2)",Force of will,Shakes off debuffs through confidence,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
13. ARMOR PENETRATION,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
MELEE ARMOR PENETRATION,,,,,,,,,
Formula,"(Str×0.2%) + (Dex×0.1%)",,,,,,
Calculation,14% + 5% = 19%,,,,,,
Effect,"Bypasses 19% of enemy armor",,,,,,
Cap,50%,"Cannot exceed 50% penetration",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
RANGED ARMOR PENETRATION,,,,,,,,,
Formula,"(Dex×0.2%) + (Int×0.1%)",,,,,,
Calculation,10% + 4% = 14%,,,,,,
Effect,"Bypasses 14% of enemy armor",,,,,,
Cap,50%,"Cannot exceed 50% penetration",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Armor Penetration Tiers:,,,,,,,,,
"Warrior (Str 80, Dex 40):",20% melee pen,"Strong vs heavy armor",,,,,,
"Strength Build (Str 100, Dex 20):",22% melee pen,"Maximum strength",,,,,,
"Archer (Dex 80, Int 40):",20% ranged pen,"Precision shots",,,,,,
"Balanced (Str 60, Dex 60):",18% melee pen,"Hybrid fighter",,,,,,
Your Build:,"19% melee, 14% ranged",Good penetration,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Practical Impact vs Armored Enemies:,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Enemy: Light Armor (100 armor rating),,,,,,,,,
No Penetration,"50% reduction, 50 damage taken",,,,,,
19% Penetration,"Effective 81 armor = 44.8% reduction, 55.2 damage",,,,,,
Impact:,+10.4% damage,"Modest improvement",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Enemy: Medium Armor (200 armor rating),,,,,,,,,
No Penetration,"66.7% reduction, 33.3 damage taken",,,,,,
19% Penetration,"Effective 162 armor = 61.8% reduction, 38.2 damage",,,,,,
Impact:,+14.7% damage,"Noticeable improvement",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Enemy: Heavy Armor (400 armor rating),,,,,,,,,
No Penetration,"80% reduction (capped), 20 damage taken",,,,,,
19% Penetration,"Effective 324 armor = 76.4% reduction, 23.6 damage",,,,,,
Impact:,+18% damage,"Strong improvement",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
INTEGRATION WITH DAMAGE FORMULA,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Stage 4: Resistance (UPDATED),,,,,,,,,
Step 1: Apply Armor Penetration,,,,,,,,,
"Enemy Effective Armor = Enemy Armor × (1 - Armor Pen %)",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Step 2: Calculate Armor Reduction,,,,,,,,,
"Armor Reduction % = min(80%, Effective Armor / (Effective Armor + 100))",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Step 3: Apply All Resistances,,,,,,,,,
"Final Damage = Stage 3 × (1 - Damage Type Resist) × (1 - Armor Reduction)",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Example with Your Stats:,,,,,,,,,
Base Damage (Stage 3),100,"After hit location",,,,,,
vs Enemy (200 armor),,,,,,,
Armor Pen (19%),162 effective armor,"=200×0.81",,,,,,
Armor Reduction,61.8%,"=162/(162+100)",,,,,,
Final Damage,38.2,"=100×(1-0.618)",,,,,,
Without Armor Pen,33.3,"+14.7% damage from penetration",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
=== HARD CAPS SYSTEM ===,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,

Memory Recovery,"Rest/Clarity potions only","No MP regen - memory-based system",,,,,,
Lifesteal %,50%,"Cannot full heal on every hit, moderate sustain",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,

CAP BREAKPOINTS ANALYSIS,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
At what stat values do you hit caps?,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Movement Speed (cap 1.5×):,,,,,,,,,
Formula: 1.0 + (Agility / 300),,,,,,,,,
Cap at Agility:,150,"+50% movement",,,,,,
Your Agility:,60 (1.2×),"30 points below cap",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Action Speed (cap 2.0×):,,,,,,,,,
Formula: 0.70 + (Action Speed / 500),,,,,,,,,
Cap at Action Speed:,650,"2.0× speed",,,,,,
Your Action Speed:,325 (1.35×),"325 points below cap",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Critical Chance Melee (cap 50%):,,,,,,,,,
Formula: 5% + (Dex×0.1%) + (Int×0.05%),,,,,,,,,
Cap at Dexterity:,450 Dex (or equivalent),"50% crit",,,,,,
Your Melee Crit:,12%,"38% below cap",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Armor Reduction (cap 80%):,,,,,,,,,
Formula: min(80% Armor/(Armor+100)),,,,,,,,,
Cap at Armor:,400,80% reduction,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Armor Penetration (cap 50%):,,,,,,,,,
Melee: (Str×0.2%) + (Dex×0.1%),,,,,,,,,
Cap at Strength:,250 Str (or equivalent),"50% pen",,,,,,
Your Melee Pen:,19%,"31% below cap",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
DIMINISHING RETURNS ZONES,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Some stats have soft caps where efficiency drops,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Armor Rating:,,,,,,,,,
"0-100 armor",Efficient,"Linear gains",,,,,,
"100-200 armor",Moderate,"Diminishing returns start",,,,,,
"200-400 armor",Poor,"Heavy diminishing returns",,,,,,
"400+ armor",Capped,No further benefit,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Agility (Movement Speed):,,,,,,,,,
"0-90 Agi",Efficient,"30% movement bonus",,,,,,
"90-150 Agi",Moderate,"Approaching cap",,,,,,
"150+ Agi",Capped,"50% movement, cannot exceed",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
=== COOLDOWN SYSTEM (OPTIONAL) ===,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
"Note: Current design uses memory-based magic, not MP/mana",,,,,,,,,
"Cooldowns could be added for non-spell abilities:",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
COOLDOWN REDUCTION FORMULA,,,,,,,,,
Formula,"(Edu×0.15%) + (Dex×0.1%) + (Social×0.05%)",,,,,,
Your CDR,11%,"=7.5% + 5% + 1.5%",,,,,,
Cap,70%,"Minimum 30% cooldown remains",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Your CDR Calculation:,,,,,,,,,
Education (50),7.5%,"=50×0.15%",,,,,,
Dexterity (50),5%,"=50×0.1%",,,,,,
Social (30),1.5%,"=30×0.05%",,,,,,
Total CDR,14%,"Modest reduction",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Practical Examples:,,,,,,,,,
"Ultimate ability (60 sec cooldown):",51.6 sec,"=60×(1-0.14)",,,,,,
"Dash ability (10 sec cooldown):",8.6 sec,"=10×(1-0.14)",,,,,,
"Buff spell (30 sec cooldown):",25.8 sec,"=30×(1-0.14)",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
CDR Tiers:,,,,,,,,,
Scholar (Edu 100 Dex 60 Social 40),"15%+6%+2%=23% CDR",Strong cooldown reduction,,,,,,
Balanced (Edu 60 Dex 60 Social 40),"9%+6%+2%=17% CDR",Moderate reduction,,,,,,
Warrior (Edu 30 Dex 40 Social 30),"4.5%+4%+1.5%=10% CDR",Low reduction,,,,,,
Your Build:,14% CDR,Below average,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
HYBRID SYSTEM DESIGN,,,,,,,,,
"If using both memory AND cooldowns:",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Ultimate Abilities:,,,,,,,,,
"- Memory: 7 slots (preparation)",Must be prepared in grimoire,,,,,,
"- Cooldown: 60 sec",Time gate on powerful abilities,,,,,,
"- Effect: Massive damage/utility",Justifies both costs,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Why Hybrid?:,,,,,,,,,
"- Prevents memory slot spam",Cannot prepare 15 ultimates,,,,,,
"- Prevents cooldown abuse",Still need spell failures to consider,,,,,,
"- Creates tactical decisions",Which spells to prepare?,,,,,,
"- Balances casters",Memory limits diversity,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
