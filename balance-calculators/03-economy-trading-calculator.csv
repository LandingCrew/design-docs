At what Speech level does crafting become profitable?,,,,,,
- Basic items: Speech 20+,,,,,,
- Advanced items: Speech 40+,,,,,,
- Master items: Speech 60+,,,,,,
,,,,,,
PRICE ELASTICITY ANALYSIS,,,,,,
,,,,,,
If iron ore price drops 50% (saturation):,,,,,,
- Mining becomes less profitable,,,,,,
"- Players switch to other materials (steel, elven)",,,,,,
- Demand recovers after 48-hour restock,,,,,,
,,,,,,
If weapon prices rise 100% (frontier):,,,,,,
- Crafting weapons for sale becomes VERY profitable,,,,,,
- But material costs also high in frontier,,,,,,
- Best strategy: Craft in city sell in frontier,,,,,,
,,,,,,
